# Nathan’s Hot-Dog Eating Contest 

This includes a reconstruction of Nathan Yau’s hot dog contest example, as interpreted by Jackie Wirz, ported into R and ggplot2 by Steven Bedrick for a workshop for the OHSU Data Science Institute, and finally adapted by Alison Hill for all you intrepid Data-Viz-onauts!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
hot_dogs <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/cs631-hotdog", 
    col_types = cols(
      gender = col_factor(levels = NULL)
    ))
```

We'll be making this plot!
