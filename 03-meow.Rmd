# Colors with Animal Sounds

For the rest of today, we’ll play with the sounds dataset. This data was derived from the R package wordbankr, an R interface to access Wordbank- an open source database of children’s vocabulary development. The tool used to measure children’s language and communicative development in this database is the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MB-CDI). The MD-CDI is a parent-reported questionnaire.

```{r}
library(readr)
sounds <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/cs631-meow")
```

We'll be making this plot!
